This directory contains tests for the reporting system.

There are two kinds of tests: real-data tests and false-data tests. The
false-data tests send many fake events of resource usage, then generate
reports based upon that fake data. The real-data tests generate real
data by creating instances or S3 buckets, then verify that
reporting events were sent and ended up in the database. Together, these
provide adequate coverage: we know that events are sent (from the real-
data tests), that events make it into the DB (from the real-data tests),
and that reports are generated correctly from data in the DB (from the
fake-data tests).


--- FAKE-DATA TESTS ---

Fake-data tests are used because we cannot generate enough real data
quickly enough to test the reports. It would require starting
thousands of instances and running them for hours. So we generate fake
events instead.

The fake-data tests are in the following scripts:
	runInstanceReportingTest.sh
	runStorageReportingTest.sh
	runS3ReportingTest.sh

Each will return 0 upon success.

The fake data tests generate reports in CSV format, then verify the
correctness of those reports, using a tool called CsvChecker which
is checked into the source repository. The CsvChecker tool
compares a CSV file against a reference CSV file based upon rules.
The CsvChecker tool relies upon reference CSV files which are located
in this directoy (instanceReference.csv, storageReference.csv,
and s3Reference.csv) which indicate what the reports should look
like.

--- REAL-DATA TESTS ---

The real-data tests don't test report genertaion; that is tested only
by the fake-data tests. The only reason we have real-data tests, is
because the fake-data tests do not verify that any events actually
are sent when instances are started etc. Thus, we have real-data
tests for that. The real-data tests start actual instances, etc,
then verify that events are sent, and that data with correct
timestamps is added to the database.

The real-data tests are in the following scripts:
	runRealInstanceReportingTest.sh
	runRealStorageReportingTest.sh
	runRealS3ReportingTest.sh

Each will return 0 upon success.

The s3 test relies upon s3curl.pl which is located in this directory.

All the real-data tests rely upon within_error.bc which is a bc
script to verify that numeric values fall within ranges.

Some real-data tests rely upon data.txt which is filled with dummy
data for creating S3 objects, etc.
