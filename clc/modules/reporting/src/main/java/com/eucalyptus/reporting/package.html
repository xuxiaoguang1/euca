<p>The reporting package generates visual reports of eucalyptus usage
statistics. For example, it generates reports of instance usage, S3 usage,
and EBS usage.

<p>The reporting package is also responsible for tracking usage statistics
and recording them in a database. Some usage statistics (like instance usage)
are statistically sampled every interval, whereas others (like S3 usage) are
recorded every time some event occurs, like resource allocation.

<p>The reporting system has a single entry point: the <code>generateReport</code>
method in the <code>ReportGenerator</code> class. All reports are generated
by calling that single method.

<p><i>Implementation</i>

<p>The reporting system is broken down into several <i>Reporting Modules</i>.
Each module tracks its own usage statistics, has its own event listener, and
has its own database tables. All reporting modules implement the
<code>ReportingModule</code> interface, and
are organized as sub-packages under the "com.eucalyptus.reporting.modules"
package. When a report is generated, the reporting system calls a specific
module to gather aggregate historical statistics, then feeds this information
to Jasper to generate a report.

<p>At present, three reporting modules are implemented: Instance, EBS, and S3.
Additional reporting modules could be added, by adding additional
sub-packages and implementing the ReportingModule interface; this would
allow the reporting system to track additional kinds of usage statistics.

<p>All reporting modules gather usage data by means of events. Events are
sent from various components of Eucalyptus (like the CLC and Walrus) to the
reporting modules, either periodically or whenever some usage occurs.
The events are aggregated into reporting statistics which are stored in the
various module database tables.

<p>Usage statistics are aggregated and stored in the database as a series of
<i>snapshots</i>.  Each snapshot contains the total usage for a given
(user,account,cluster,avail_zone) tuple at a given moment in time.

<p>The current reporting modules all share a common structure and a similar way
of storing statistics as snapshots. However, this is only a <i>convention</i>
which has been followed for the existing reporting modules.  Any future
reporting module need not have similar classes or a similar organiztion;
it needs only to have its own module sub-package, and to implement
ReportingModule and ReportLine interfaces. It can store, aggregate, and
retrieve its statistics in any manner chosen by the developer.  It need not
necessarily store its statistics as a series of snapshots either.

<p>In addition to the reporting modules, the reporting system also has a
super-structure, which loads the modules, queries the modules for data,
listens for (and parses) web requests, maintains a queue of events,
generates visual reports using Jasper, caches frequently used reports, and so
on.

<p>The super-structure has a <i>queue</i> package for transmitting
events over the network if necessary, and a <i>units</i> package for unit
conversions.
